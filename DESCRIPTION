Description: The goal of `PWCfilegenerator` is to obtain the weather file necessary to run the models Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) v1.52 and Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM5) v5.02. 
    These models used in pesticide risk assessment are available to download for free from the [USEPA website](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-science-and-assessing-pesticide-risks/models-pesticide-risk-assessment).
    The function `PWCfilegenerator::PWC_fg()` converts a weather dataset to the file format read as input for PRZM5 and PWC.
