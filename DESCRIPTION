Description: The goal of the function PWCfilegenerator::PWC_fg() is to convert a weather dataset to the input file format needed to run the models Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) v1.52 and Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM5) v5.02.
    PWC and PRZM5 are mathematical models used for pesticide fate modelling and are free to download from the USEPA website. These models are employed for regulatory purposes as part of surface water exposure characterization during pesticide risk assessment.
    Although PWC has a simple and intuitive interface, the weather files required to run the model are only available for North America, making it difficult for users lacking programming skills to run the model in other countries. The package PWCfilegenerator v0.1.0 facilitates the construction of weather files in PWC format from common databases
